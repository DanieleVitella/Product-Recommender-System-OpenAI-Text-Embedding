# **Product Recommender System: OpenAI Text Embedding**

A renowned online shopping platform named GlimmerGate needs help to improve their product recommendation system. **They aim to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their recent product views.**

They have provided a product dataset containing information such as:
- title 
- description
- ID  

About 2000 of their products. Additionally, they have supplied a list of 10 recently viewed products by a user. 

**They want you to develop a prototype to recommend products that the user has never viewed before, based on their recently viewed products by leveraging OpenAI's text embedding models to build a text-based recommendation system using Python.**
